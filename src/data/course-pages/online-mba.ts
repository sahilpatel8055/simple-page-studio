  intro:
    "An Online MBA is a two-year postgraduate management degree delivered through a university's online learning platform. This page compares the universities in our dataset that publish an Online MBA — their fees, specialisations, eligibility, examination structure and approvals — so you can shortlist on evidence rather than advertising.",

  overview: [
    "An Online MBA is the Master of Business Administration studied through a university's online mode. Teaching, study material, assessment and student support are delivered digitally, while the degree itself is awarded by the university under the same nomenclature it uses for its campus programme, subject to the entitlement that applies to that university and programme for your admission year.",
    "The purpose of the degree is to build general management capability: reading financial statements, understanding customers and markets, structuring operations, working with data, and leading teams through change. Most curricula start with a common core across accounting, economics, marketing, operations, organisational behaviour and strategy, and then narrow into a specialisation in the later semesters.",
    "Online delivery usually combines live weekend or evening classes with recorded lectures, a learning management system that holds the semester plan and submissions, graded assignments through the term, and university-specified term-end examinations. Many programmes finish with a capstone project or dissertation where the curriculum requires one.",
    "The format is chosen most often by people who cannot pause employment: mid-career professionals moving from a specialist role into management, graduates working while they study, founders who need finance and operations depth, and learners in cities where the university they want has no campus. It suits self-directed study, because attendance pressure is replaced by personal scheduling.",
    "What varies between universities is significant: total cost, specialisation list, whether a specialisation can be changed later, examination mode and proctoring, project requirements, and the extent of career support. Those differences are the reason this page leads with a university comparison rather than a single set of numbers.",

    {
      question: "Is placement guaranteed after an Online MBA?",
