  intro:
    "An Online BBA is a three-year undergraduate management degree delivered through a university's online learning platform. This page compares the universities in our dataset that publish an Online BBA — their fees, specialisations, eligibility, examination structure and approvals — so you can shortlist a programme on evidence rather than advertising.",

  overview: [
    "An Online BBA is the Bachelor of Business Administration studied through a university's online mode. Lectures, reading material, assignments and assessment are conducted digitally, while the degree itself is awarded by the university under the same nomenclature it uses for its on-campus programme, subject to the entitlement that applies to that university and programme for your admission year.",
    "The degree is built to introduce learners to how a business actually functions before they specialise anywhere. Early semesters typically cover the foundations — management principles, business communication, accounting, economics and quantitative methods — and later semesters add marketing, human resources, operations, business law and a chosen specialisation stream.",
    "Because it is a first degree rather than a professional add-on, an Online BBA is usually taken straight after Class 12, though working learners, gap-year candidates and those switching from another undergraduate stream also enrol. The online format removes the need to relocate to a campus city and lets a learner combine study with a part-time job, an internship or family responsibilities.",
    "Delivery normally combines live classes on a fixed weekly timetable with recorded lectures for revision, a learning management system that holds the syllabus and submissions, continuous assignments through the semester, and term-end examinations set by the university. Many programmes close with a final-year project or dissertation that applies classroom concepts to a real or simulated business problem.",
    "What differs meaningfully between universities is the specialisation list, whether a specialisation can be changed after admission, the examination mode and proctoring approach, the total cost once all charges are added, and the extent of academic and career support. Those differences are why this page opens with a university comparison instead of a single generic answer.",

    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online BBA valid in India?",
      answer:
        "Validity depends on the university and on the regulatory entitlement or approval that applies to that specific programme for your admission period. Verify the status for the exact university, programme and academic year before enrolling.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online BBA UGC recognised?",
      answer:
        "Recognition is programme-specific, not universal. Check the university's UGC entitlement status for the online mode, for the BBA specifically, and for your admission year, rather than assuming it applies across the board.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the duration of an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "Three years across six semesters in most programmes. Some universities publish a maximum permissible duration that allows completion over a longer period if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the eligibility for an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "A Class 12 (10+2) pass from a recognised board, in any stream, is the common requirement. Minimum marks and any entrance condition are set by each university.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does an Online BBA cost?",
      answer:
        'Fees are set by each university, so the range is wide. The university comparison on this page shows the published figure for each programme in our dataset, and marks anything we could not verify as "Not specified".',
    },
    {
      question: "Is an entrance examination required for an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "Usually not. Most universities in our dataset admit directly on Class 12 marks. A small number may run their own aptitude or admission test — confirm with the specific university.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pursue an Online BBA while working part-time?",
      answer:
        "Yes — the format is built for it, with recorded lectures and scheduled assessments. Plan for consistent weekly study hours rather than assuming flexibility alone will be enough for three years.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which university is best for an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "There is no single best university. Compare entitlement status, total cost, the specialisation you need, examination format and support quality — the comparison tool on this page is built for exactly that.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which Online BBA specialisation should I choose?",
      answer:
        "Choose based on the type of role you find genuinely interesting, not the most advertised option. The specialisation guide on this page maps common career interests to the specialisations that support them.",
    },
    {
      question: "When do I choose a specialisation in an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "Most curricula introduce specialisation papers from the fifth semester onward, after two years of common foundational subjects. Some universities ask you to indicate a preference earlier, so check the specific programme structure.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do an MBA after an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "Yes. A BBA is a standard qualifying degree for MBA admission, subject to the postgraduate programme's own minimum-marks and, where applicable, entrance-test requirements.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online BBA equivalent to a regular BBA?",
      answer:
        "The degree nomenclature is the same when the programme carries the applicable entitlement. The experience differs: campus programmes offer in-person cohorts, hostel life and structured placement drives, while online programmes offer flexibility and lower relocation cost.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between BBA and B.Com?",
      answer:
        "A BBA is broader and management-oriented, covering marketing, HR and operations alongside finance, while a B.Com focuses more heavily on accounting, taxation and commerce fundamentals. Choose based on whether you want general management exposure or a deeper accounting-and-commerce grounding.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are Online BBA examinations conducted?",
      answer:
        "Most universities use online, remotely proctored term-end examinations alongside internal assessment such as assignments and quizzes. A few use designated centres. Confirm the mode with the university.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is attendance compulsory in an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "Live-session attendance requirements vary. Some universities recommend it, others set a minimum for eligibility to sit examinations. Read the academic regulations before enrolling.",

    {
      question: "What jobs can I get after an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "Common entry paths include sales, marketing, HR, operations, accounts and business-development executive roles. Outcomes depend on internships, demonstrable skills and the specific employer, as well as the degree.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is placement guaranteed after an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "No. Universities offer placement assistance — job boards, resume help, mock interviews, recruiter sessions — which is different from a placement guarantee. Be sceptical of any guarantee claim.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get an education loan for an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "Loan and no-cost EMI options exist through university financing partners and lenders, but approval and eligibility are decided by the lender, not the university.",
