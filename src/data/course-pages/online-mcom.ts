  intro:
    "An Online M.Com is a two-year postgraduate commerce degree delivered through a university's online learning platform. This page compares the universities in our dataset that publish an Online M.Com — their fees, specialisations, eligibility, examination structure and approvals — so you can shortlist on evidence rather than advertising.",

  overview: [
    "An Online M.Com is the Master of Commerce studied through a university's online mode. Classes, reading material, assessment and student support are delivered digitally, and the degree itself is awarded by the university under the same nomenclature it uses on campus, subject to the entitlement that applies to that university and programme for your admission year.",
    "The degree deepens the commerce foundation laid at the bachelor's stage. Most curricula build from advanced financial accounting and managerial economics into corporate finance, direct and indirect taxation, and research methods, before narrowing into a specialisation and a project or dissertation in the closing semesters. The intent is to prepare graduates for analytical, advisory and decision-support roles in finance, accounts and taxation functions, and to give a foundation for further academic or professional study.",
    "Delivery typically combines live weekend or evening sessions with recorded lectures, a learning management system that holds the semester schedule and submissions, continuous assignments, and university-specified term-end examinations. Several programmes end with a dissertation or research project, particularly where the specialisation leans toward finance or analytics.",
    "The format suits people who cannot pause work or family responsibilities to study full time: B.Com graduates who want a postgraduate qualification without a career break, working accountants and finance executives building formal credentials, candidates preparing for teaching-eligibility examinations such as UGC-NET, and learners pursuing the M.Com alongside CA, CS or CMA preparation.",
    "What differs between universities is substantial — total cost, the specialisation list, whether a dissertation is compulsory, examination mode and proctoring rules, and how much career support is offered to online learners. Treat any single number you see elsewhere as indicative only, and use the university comparison on this page to check the actual published position for your shortlist.",

    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online M.Com valid in India?",
      answer:
        "Validity depends on the university and on the regulatory entitlement or approval that applies to that specific programme for your admission period. Verify the status for the exact university, programme and academic year before enrolling.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does an Online M.Com carry the same UGC entitlement as a regular M.Com?",
      answer:
        "Only where the specific university and programme hold the applicable UGC entitlement for the online mode for your admission year. This is programme-specific, not a blanket rule for all universities, so check it individually before you pay any fee.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the duration of an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "Two years across four semesters in most programmes. Some universities publish a maximum permissible duration that allows completion over a longer period.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the eligibility for an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "A B.Com degree, or a bachelor's degree with a substantial commerce component, from a recognised institution is the common requirement. Minimum marks and any bridge-course condition for non-commerce graduates are set by each university.",

    {
      question: "Can a non-commerce graduate pursue an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "Some universities admit graduates from other streams, sometimes with bridge coursework or an additional condition. This is not universal, so confirm directly with the university before applying.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does an Online M.Com cost?",
      answer:
        'Fees are set by each university, so the range is wide. The university comparison on this page shows the published figure for each programme in our dataset, and marks anything we could not verify as "Not specified".',
    },
    {
      question: "Is an entrance examination required for an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "Not usually. Most universities in our dataset admit directly on the qualifying bachelor's degree, though this can vary — verify with the specific university.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which is better — Online M.Com or Online MBA?",
      answer:
        "They serve different goals. M.Com builds specialist depth in accounting, finance and taxation and can suit teaching, research or specialist finance roles; MBA builds broader general-management capability across functions. Choose based on the role or examination you are targeting, not on which sounds more prestigious.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online M.Com useful for UGC-NET or an assistant professorship?",
      answer:
        "A postgraduate degree such as M.Com is typically the base educational qualification for UGC-NET in commerce and for assistant professorship eligibility. The specific eligibility rules, including any recognition condition on the online mode, are set by the conducting body and should be checked directly with it before you rely on this route.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pursue a PhD after an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "Yes, in principle — a postgraduate degree is the standard entry qualification for doctoral admission in commerce or management. Acceptance of the specific online M.Com is decided by the admitting university under its own research-admission rules, so confirm this with the university you plan to apply to.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pursue an Online M.Com alongside CA, CS or CMA?",
      answer:
        "Yes, many candidates study the two together because of the subject overlap in accounting, tax and finance. Plan your weekly schedule carefully, since both tracks carry independent assessment calendars.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is a dissertation or project compulsory in an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "It depends on the university and specialisation. Several programmes include a dissertation or research project in the final semester; others use a shorter applied project. Check the specific curriculum before you enrol if this matters to you.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are Online M.Com examinations conducted?",
      answer:
        "Most universities use online, remotely proctored term-end examinations alongside internal assessment such as assignments and quizzes. A few use designated examination centres. Confirm the mode with the university.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pursue an Online M.Com while working?",
      answer:
        "Yes — the format is built for it, with recorded lectures and a semester-based assessment schedule. Plan for consistent weekly study hours rather than assuming flexibility alone will be enough.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which specialisation should I choose in an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "Choose based on the role or examination you are targeting rather than the specialisation's popularity. The specialisation guide on this page maps common goals — accounting, taxation, banking, analytics or international business — to the matching choice.",
    },
    {
      question: "What jobs can I get after an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "Common paths include accounting, tax consultancy, financial analysis, auditing support, banking operations and academic or research roles. Outcomes depend on your prior experience, any professional certification and demonstrable skills, as well as the degree.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is placement guaranteed after an Online M.Com?",
      answer:
        "No. Universities offer placement assistance — job boards, resume help, mock interviews, recruiter sessions — which is different from a placement guarantee. Be sceptical of any guarantee claim.",
    },
    {
      question: "What documents are required for admission?",
      answer:
        "Graduation marksheets and certificate, identity proof, a photograph and a signature specimen at minimum, plus any university-specific documents listed on its admission page.",
