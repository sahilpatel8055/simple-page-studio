  intro:
    "An Online M.Sc is a two-year postgraduate science degree delivered through a university's online learning platform, commonly offered in Data Science, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Environmental Science, Biotechnology and Psychology. This page compares the universities in our dataset that publish an Online M.Sc — their fees, specialisations, eligibility, examination structure and approvals — so you can shortlist on evidence rather than advertising.",

  overview: [
    "An Online M.Sc is the Master of Science degree studied through a university's online mode. Lectures, study material, assessment and student support are delivered digitally, while the degree itself carries the same nomenclature the university awards for its campus programme, subject to the entitlement or approval that applies to that university and programme for your admission year.",
    "Unlike an Online MBA, which builds general management capability, an Online M.Sc deepens subject-matter expertise in a specific scientific or technical discipline. In India, the discipline that draws the most enrolment online is Data Science, followed by Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, Environmental Science, Biotechnology and Psychology. Each discipline has its own core sequence: a Data Science or Computer Science M.Sc leans on programming, statistics, databases and machine learning, while a Mathematics or Statistics M.Sc leans on analysis, algebra, probability theory and applied modelling.",
    "Curricula are typically organised across four semesters. Early semesters build foundational theory and quantitative method; later semesters introduce electives and specialised modules, and the final semester usually carries a dissertation, research project or applied capstone. Because the subject is science rather than management, a genuine M.Sc curriculum expects rigorous problem sets, coding assignments or laboratory-adjacent practical work, not only case discussions — universities that teach a lab-dependent discipline online typically substitute virtual labs, simulation software, take-home kits or affiliated-centre practicals for physical laboratory sessions, and the extent of this varies significantly between institutions.",
    "Online delivery generally combines live evening or weekend sessions with recorded lectures, a learning management system holding the semester's schedule and submissions, continuous assignments, and university-specified term-end examinations. Learners who choose this format are usually working professionals in IT, analytics, healthcare or education who want a research-oriented postgraduate qualification without leaving employment, along with graduates preparing for further doctoral study, and candidates targeting eligibility for the UGC-NET or other research-track examinations.",
    "What varies most between universities is the specialisation on offer, the depth of practical or lab component, examination mode and proctoring, dissertation requirements, and whether the university's approvals extend to the specific discipline you want. Because these differences materially affect both learning quality and recognised outcomes, this page leads with a university comparison rather than a single set of figures.",

      question: "Can I pursue an Online M.Sc while working?",
      answer:
        "Yes — the format is built for it, with recorded lectures and scheduled assessments. Plan for consistent weekly study hours, since a genuine M.Sc curriculum expects quantitative and, in some disciplines, coding or practical rigour.",

      question: "How does an Online M.Sc compare with an MCA?",
      answer:
