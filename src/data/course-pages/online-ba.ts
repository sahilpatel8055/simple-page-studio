  intro:
    "An Online BA is a three-year undergraduate arts degree delivered through a university's online learning platform. This page compares the universities in our dataset that publish an Online BA — their fees, subject choices, eligibility, examination pattern and approvals — so you can shortlist a programme on evidence rather than advertising.",

  overview: [
    "An Online BA is the Bachelor of Arts degree studied through a university's online mode. Lectures, reading material, assignments and assessment are conducted digitally, while the degree awarded carries the same nomenclature as the university's campus BA, subject to the entitlement that applies to that university and programme for your admission year.",
    "The degree builds a broad humanities and social-science foundation. Learners typically study a mix of language and communication papers, an ability-enhancement or value-added component, and a set of core papers in a chosen discipline such as English, History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology or Economics. The later semesters usually let students choose electives and, in many curricula, complete a small project or dissertation.",
    "Delivery is generally a combination of live classes on a fixed weekly timetable, recorded lectures for revision, a learning management system that hosts notes and submissions, periodic assignments, and university-conducted term-end examinations. Because the pace is set by the university rather than a daily classroom routine, the format suits learners who need to fit study around other commitments.",
    "The Online BA is chosen by a wide mix of learners: school leavers who want a degree without relocating away from home, working adults completing a first degree while employed, aspirants preparing for civil-service or other government examinations that require a bachelor's degree, and diploma holders or dropouts finishing an interrupted undergraduate education.",
    "What differs between universities is meaningful: the list of specialisations on offer, whether a subject combination can be changed after the first year, the examination and proctoring method, project or dissertation requirements, and the total cost once all charges are added. This page leads with a university-by-university comparison for exactly that reason, rather than quoting one figure that would not hold for every institution.",

      question: "Is an Online BA valid in India?",

    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online BA UGC recognised?",
      answer:
        "Recognition is programme-specific, not universal. Check the university's UGC entitlement status for the online mode, for the BA specifically, and for your admission year, rather than assuming it from the university's overall reputation.",

    {
      question: "What is the duration of an Online BA?",

        "Three years across six semesters in most programmes. Some universities publish a maximum permissible duration that allows completion over a longer period under a credit-based system.",

    {
      question: "What is the eligibility for an Online BA?",

      question: "How much does an Online BA cost?",

    {
      question: "Do I need an entrance exam for an Online BA?",
      answer:
        "Usually not. Most universities in our dataset admit directly on the Class 12 marksheet, though a few may set additional requirements for specific specialisations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pursue an Online BA while working?",
      answer:
        "Yes — the format is built for it, with recorded lectures and a semester-based assessment calendar. Plan for consistent weekly study hours rather than assuming flexibility alone will be enough.",

      question: "Which specialisation should I choose in an Online BA?",

      question: "Is an Online BA equivalent to a regular BA?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "Am I eligible for government jobs with an Online BA?",
      answer:

    {
      question: "Can I pursue an MA after an Online BA?",
      answer:

      question: "How are Online BA examinations conducted?",

      question: "What is the difference between Online BA, BBA and B.Com?",
      answer:
        "A BA covers humanities and social-science disciplines such as English, History, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology and Economics. A BBA focuses on business administration and management, and a B.Com focuses on commerce, accounting and finance. Choose based on the discipline and career direction you want, not the perceived difficulty of any one degree.",

    {
      question: "Can I change my specialisation later in an Online BA?",
      answer:

    },
    {
      question: "What jobs can I get after an Online BA?",
      answer:
        "Common paths include content and editorial roles, teaching, social work, journalism, administrative and HR-support roles, and eligibility for government examinations. Outcomes depend on additional skills, certifications and the specific role as well as the degree.",

    {
      question: "Is placement support available for an Online BA?",
      answer:
        "Some universities offer placement assistance for online undergraduate learners, but this is not standard across the board and is never a guarantee of a job. Ask the university in writing what support it provides.",

    {
      question: "Can I get an education loan or EMI option for an Online BA?",
      answer:
        "No-cost EMI and loan options exist through university financing partners and lenders for many programmes, but approval and eligibility are decided by the lender, not the university.",
    },
