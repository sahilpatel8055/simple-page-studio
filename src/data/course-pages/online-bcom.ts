  intro:
    "An Online B.Com is a three-year undergraduate commerce degree delivered through a university's online learning platform. This page compares the universities in our dataset that publish this course — their fees, specialisations, eligibility, examination structure and approvals — so you can shortlist on evidence rather than advertising.",

  overview: [
    "An Online B.Com is the Bachelor of Commerce degree studied through a university's online mode, where lectures, study material, assignments and assessments are delivered digitally while the degree itself is awarded by the university under the same nomenclature it uses for its campus programme, subject to the entitlement that applies to that university and programme for your admission year.",
    "The curriculum builds a foundation in accounting, business economics, business law, taxation and quantitative methods, and then layers in corporate accounting, cost and management accounting, auditing and indirect taxation as the programme progresses. Many universities also weave in computer applications, business communication and entrepreneurship papers so the degree reads as a rounded commerce qualification rather than a narrow bookkeeping course.",
    "Online delivery typically combines live evening or weekend classes with recorded lectures, a learning management system holding the semester's schedule and submissions, continuous assignments, and university-specified term-end examinations across six semesters. Some programmes end with a project or applied study in the final year.",
    "The format suits school leavers who want to keep studying while gaining early work experience, working professionals in accounts, finance or back-office roles who need a formal degree to progress, and candidates preparing for CA, CS or CMA who want a parallel undergraduate qualification without attending a full-time campus programme. It also reaches learners in towns where a preferred university has no local college.",
    "What differs between universities is significant: total cost, specialisation options in the later semesters, examination mode and proctoring, whether a value-added certification is bundled in, and the depth of student support. Those differences are why this page leads with a university-by-university comparison instead of a single set of figures.",

      question: "What is an Online B.Com?",

        "It is the Bachelor of Commerce degree studied through a university's online mode, with digital classes, study material, assignments and university-specified examinations across six semesters. The degree is awarded by the university itself.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online B.Com valid in India?",
      answer:
        "Validity depends on the university and on the regulatory entitlement or approval that applies to that specific programme for your admission period. Verify the status for the exact university, programme and academic year before enrolling.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online B.Com UGC recognised?",
      answer:
        "Recognition is programme-specific, not universal. Check the university's UGC entitlement status for the online mode, for the B.Com specifically, and for your admission year, rather than assuming online study in general is or is not recognised.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the duration of an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "Three years across six semesters in most programmes. Some universities publish a maximum permissible duration that allows you to complete over a longer period if needed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the eligibility for an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "A pass in 10+2 from a recognised board, generally in any stream, is the common requirement. Minimum marks and any additional conditions are set by each university.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does an Online B.Com cost?",
      answer:
        'Fees are set by each university, so the range is wide. The university comparison on this page shows the published figure for each programme in our dataset, and marks anything we could not verify as "Not specified".',
    },
    {
      question: "How do I get admission to an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "Most universities admit directly on the basis of your Class 12 marksheet through their online admission portal — register, upload documents, pay the applicable instalment and receive LMS access. A few universities may set additional conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "How are Online B.Com examinations conducted?",
      answer:
        "Most universities use online, remotely proctored term-end examinations alongside internal assessment through assignments and quizzes. A few use designated centres. Confirm the mode with the university.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I pursue an Online B.Com alongside CA, CS or CMA?",
      answer:
        "Yes, and it is one of the more common reasons students choose this format. Recorded lectures and a flexible semester calendar make it easier to balance with articleship, training or coaching-class schedules than a full-time campus degree.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can working professionals in accounts or finance pursue an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The format is designed for people who are already employed, letting you study around your job while working toward a formal qualification that can support progression or a role change.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I do an M.Com or an MBA after an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "Yes, subject to the admitting institution's own eligibility rules. A B.Com is a standard qualifying degree for both an M.Com and most MBA programmes, including specialisations in finance.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a government job after an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "Many government and public-sector recruitment exams accept any bachelor's degree, including a B.Com, as the minimum qualification. Check the specific eligibility notice for the post you are targeting, since some recruiters do scrutinise the mode of study.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between an Online B.Com and an Online BBA?",
      answer:
        "A B.Com focuses on accounting, taxation, auditing and commerce law, and is a common route into finance, accounts and tax roles or professional courses like CA and CMA. A BBA is broader management education covering marketing, HR and operations alongside finance, and suits students aiming more generally at management roles.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which Online B.Com specialisation should I choose?",
      answer:
        "Choose from the role or professional course you are targeting, not from the trend. The specialisation guide on this page maps common goals — such as taxation practice or banking operations — to the specialisation that supports them.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is an Online B.Com equivalent to a regular B.Com?",
      answer:
        "The degree nomenclature is the same when the programme carries the applicable entitlement. The experience differs: campus programmes offer in-person classes and a college environment, online programmes offer flexibility and continuity of work or other commitments.",
    },
    {
      question: "What jobs can I get after an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "Common entry points include accounting, tax assistance, auditing support, banking operations and accounts-executive roles. Outcomes depend heavily on any professional qualification, internship experience and demonstrable skills alongside the degree.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the salary after an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "It varies widely by role, employer, city and any additional qualification such as CA, CS or CMA. We deliberately do not publish a single national average, because such figures are rarely sourced or comparable.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is placement guaranteed after an Online B.Com?",
      answer:
        "No. Universities offer placement assistance — job boards, resume help, mock interviews — which is different from a placement guarantee. Be sceptical of any guarantee claim, and ask what support actually applies to online learners.",
    },
