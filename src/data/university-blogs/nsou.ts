It suits students who need a low-cost, recognised degree while working, preparing for competitive exams, or managing family responsibilities, but it is a weaker fit for anyone expecting campus-style placements or a premium brand name. This guide weighs NSOU's value against the alternatives so you can decide with realistic expectations.",
