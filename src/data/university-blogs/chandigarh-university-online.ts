      "Chandigarh University Online is worth considering if you want a UGC-entitled, NAAC A+ accredited degree with flexible fees, early bird scholarships and no-cost EMI, without the cost of hostel and travel that a regular on-campus programme carries. It is a strong fit for working professionals and career changers, though the flexibility trade-off means less in-person campus interaction. This guide compares scholarships, fee savings and the online-versus-regular decision to help you judge fit.",
