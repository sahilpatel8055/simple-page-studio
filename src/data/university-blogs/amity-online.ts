    intro:
      "Amity University Online is worth it for working professionals and students who value flexibility, UGC-DEB recognition and global accreditations like WES, WASC and QAA, especially when paired with ISAT-based scholarships. It is a less clear win if your only priority is the lowest possible fee, since government options like IGNOU cost a fraction of Amity's fees. This guide compares Amity Online's scholarships, EMI options and overall value against IGNOU and other alternatives so you can decide with the full picture.",
